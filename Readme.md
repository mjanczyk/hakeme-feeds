# HakemeFeeds #

This is a learning project (playground project) created using fpcomplete.com IDE (beta).

This project is a webapp that scraps and exports RSS/Atom feeds for websites
[hakeme.pl](http://hakeme.pl "Hakeme digital painting tutorials, PL") and
[hakeme.com](http://hakeme.com "Hakeme digital painting tutorials, EN"), which are
awesome sites with digital painting tutorials, but unfortunately, as of today,
they lack newsfeeds.
